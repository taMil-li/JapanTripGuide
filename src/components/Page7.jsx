            Japan offers diverse experiences-from Kyoto's temples and Gion
            district to Tokyo's modern landmarks and Hokkaido's nature trails.
            Popular attractions like tea ceremonies, cultural workshops, theme
            parks, and seasonal illuminations often need advance booking. Early
            closing times at temples and shrines mean careful itinerary planning
            is important, especially during cherry blossom or autumn foliage
            seasons.
